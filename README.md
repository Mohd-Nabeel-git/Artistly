# 🎭 Artistly — Where Vision Turns Into Reality

**Artistly.com** is a fictional performing artist booking platform built as part of a frontend development assignment. It showcases a seamless and responsive interface for connecting **Event Planners** with **Artist Managers**, allowing them to explore artists, send booking requests, and manage leads—all through a modern, UI-driven frontend.

> ⚠️ This is a static frontend demo. Backend logic and database connections are mocked using JSON files.
